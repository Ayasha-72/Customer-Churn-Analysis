## 📂 Dataset
**Telco Customer Churn Dataset**  
The dataset contains customer information such as:
- Contract type  
- Monthly charges  
- Tenure (how long the customer stayed)  
- Payment method  
- Churn status (Yes / No)


## 📊 Data Analysis & Visual Insights

### 1️⃣ Customer Churn Count
**What the graph shows:**  
Number of customers who stayed vs customers who left.

**Insight:**  
Most customers stayed, but a significant number of customers left the company.  
This indicates that customer churn is a real business problem and needs attention.

---

### 2️⃣ Churn by Contract Type
**What the graph shows:**  
Customer churn based on contract duration (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).

**Insight:**  
- Month-to-month customers churn the most  
- Customers with long-term contracts churn much less  

**Reason:**  
Customers who are not locked into long-term plans can leave easily.

---

### 3️⃣ Monthly Charges vs Churn
**What the graph shows:**  
Comparison of monthly charges between customers who stayed and those who left.

**Insight:**  
Customers paying higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.

**Reason:**  
High cost without perceived value makes customers switch to competitors.

---

### 4️⃣ Tenure Distribution by Churn
**What the graph shows:**  
How long customers stayed before leaving.

**Insight:**  
- New customers (low tenure) churn more  
- Customers who stay longer tend to remain loyal  

**Reason:**  
Early customer experience strongly affects retention.

---

### 5️⃣ Payment Method vs Churn
**What the graph shows:**  
Churn behavior based on payment method.

**Insight:**  
- Manual payment users (electronic check) churn more  
- Auto-payment users churn less  

**Reason:**  
Automatic payments increase convenience and reduce churn.

## 💡 Key Business Insights (Summary)
- Month-to-month contract customers have the highest churn
